# Java-Hollow_Diamond_Patterns
This Java program generates a hollow diamond star pattern based on user input size. It uses nested for loops to control spaces and stars, creating an upper and lower triangular shape forming a diamond. Outer loops manage rows, inner loops print spaces and stars only at boundaries, leaving the inner region hollow. Suitable for pattern practice.
